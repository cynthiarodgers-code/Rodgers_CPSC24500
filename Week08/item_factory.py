item_factory.py - Week 8 

ItemFactory uses the FACTORY pattern. The caller passes a string like "Book"
and the factory returns the right concrete subclass.

Tip: a dictionary mapping type strings to classes works well, but a simple
if/elif chain is also fine.

create_item(item_type, title, author, year, *extras)
- item_type: "Book", "DVD", or "Magazine" (case-insensitive)
- For Book, extras are: isbn, page_count
- For DVD, extras are: runtime_minutes, rating
- For Magazine, extras are: issue_number, month
- Raise ValueError for unknown types
